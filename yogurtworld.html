                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded">
                      For COGS 187B: Practicum in Pro Web Design at UC San Diego, I worked with two other students to
                      design and create a website for a local business of our choice. We worked with Yogurt World as our
                      client, who did not previously have a website for the shop. This website was designed and targeted
                      toward a specific audience based on a variety of interviews we conducted, observations we made, and
                      competitive analyses that we performed. Due to restrictions with publishing the website and limitations
                      and regulations with the University, Yogurt World has not been able to implement the website we
                      designed for them.
                    </p>
                    <h4>My Role</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded">
                      I worked with three other classmates on this project. We each interviewed customers and store
                      employees. I designed a large number of the wireframes in Sketch for quick prototyping and testing
                      in Invision. I also edited several of the images and helped code and style the website in HTML and CSS.

                    <h4 class="section-heading">User Research</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded">
                      We started off by interviewing our client to gather information on our client's
                      target audience and their needs for the site. We also conducted our first round of
                      interviews and observations. We asked questions about Yogurt World to both customers
                      and non-customers.
                      After this first round of interviews, we aggregated all the data and looked for any
                      patterns in responses. From our analysis of the data, we were able to develop three
                      different user groups based on the research that we did: frequent customers,
                      non-frequent customers, and prospective customers. After this, we were able to formulate
                      new questions for each different persona and conduct a second round of interviews in order
                      to figure out their behaviors and needs for different website features.
                    </p>

                <div class="col-lg-6">
                  <h4 class="section-heading">Competitive Analysis</h4>
                  <p class="text-faded">
                    We looked at other websites of similar types of stores, or websites that the owner
                    particularly liked and tried to dig into why the owner liked these features and what
                    made these features enable a better experience to visitors.
                    We developed a site map in order to outline and organize specific features of the
                    site that will be included, based on the data we collected. From this site map, we developed
                    a low-fidelity prototype.

                <div class="col-lg-12">
                  <h4 class="section-heading">Prototyping & Solution</h4>
                  <p class="text-faded">
                    By using data to inform our solution, the main features we decided to include were a page that listed all
                    of the flavors that Yogurt World had to offer, as well as the flavors that the shop
                    had that day. There is also a section for fundraisers, since Yogurt World works constantly with
                    various student organizations on campus to organize fundraisers. We were able to test our
                    prototype on people from each of the different user groups (frequent customers, non-frequent
                    customers, and prospective customers), and found positive results from testing. One thing
                    that was noted on multiple occassions of testing was that customers wanted a quick way to
                    sort through and view the flavors. Also, many people noted that they have certain dietary needs/preferences,
                    and this was one thing that made Yogurt World special. Yogurt World has a wide selection of flavors
                    for various dietary preferences.
                    <br><br>
                    In our next iteration, we added a sorting/filter feature for the flavors in which
                    customers can filter flavors based on specific dietary needs. For example, if a customer
                    wants to view dairy free options, they would just select that filter and the set of
                    corresponding flavors would be presented.
