                  <p>
                    We started off by conducting research and interviews. We first researched demographics and statistics to gain a better understanding of the population surrounding the museum. We conducted various types of interviews: both expert and user interviews. We were able to take a visit to the Brooklyn Historical Society and gather information about the site and about museums in general, particularly details on the structure of the creative exhibits at the Brooklyn Historical Society. We were able to conduct user interviews and a quick survey on what types of people visit museums, why people visit museums and what made their experience positive or negative. In the interviews, it was found that the three things people disliked the most about museums were navigation, museum hours, and lack of interactive exhibits. We decided to focus on one of these areas and began to ask the question:

                  <h4>Brainstorming & Prototyping & Testing & Iterating</h4>
                  <p>
                    After a couple rounds of "How Might We's" and sketching all possible ideas in response to a "How Might We" question, we combined various ideas to create an interactive exhibit, in which a visitor would learn about the history of slavery and abolitionists through a series of projections, audio, and questions. The answers that the visitor selects would determine the path that they go on inside this exhibit, and audio and projections would play in a certain spot on the path as the visitor walks over that spot. However, after testing this idea with several people, we quickly learned that this exhibit felt more like a game to testers, which provided some implications to retaining the authenticity of the history of slavery.
                    <br><br>
                    After this, we decided to bring the subject of our interactive prototype to be of the museum in particular. This new prototype was an Augmented Reality exhibit in which users could see what the museum (home to abolitionists) looked like in the past, while also listening to the stories of previous slaves and abolitionists. This would allow the user to learn more about the history of the museum as well as the history of slavery in an interactive way. However, after testing this prototype several times and conducting a post-test survey, we found that users were not really learning anything from it. For many users, this solution was too distracting; the user either focused on the audio or on the Augmented Reality feature. Also, if the user focused on the audio, they didn't really remember or learn anything from it afterward. We had to take a large step back and really think about and assess whether or not our current solution was accomplishing our original goal.

                  <p>
                    After realizing that our last prototype was ineffective in accomplishing our main goal, we went back to the drawing board. We decided to interview more people to discover if and how they learn at museums. From our research, we moved onto brainstorming a new solution, and realized that aside from being exposed to new knowledge, the user had to reinforce this knowledge in a way so that they would remember it and actually learn. So with that in mind, we turned the digital idea we had previously prototyped into a physical version--photo books. These photobooks would come with the audio that was designed for the previous prototype. This took away the distraction of the Augmented Reality portion, and instead put the focus on the story. We also prototyped response boards with questions that probed the user to think back to the material presented in the exhibit so that they could reflect on it and reinforce it.

                  Upon testing our prototype, we found that users were not able to interact as much with the exhibit as we had hoped for, and that the questions we posed should be more reflective and related to the specific material that the visitor was exposed to in the exhibit. We turned the photo books into boxes that will play the audio related to the story as the user turns the boxes. This creates more interaction that the user must go through to hear the stories. Using a physical action to reveal also promotes reinforcement of remembering the material.

                  Lastly, we iterated upon our prototype to be designed for accessibility. We digitally sketched the concept of having adjustably heights of the photo boxes so that those with a physical disability can adjust the exhibit to accommodate for their needs. We also imprinted Braille onto the sides of the boxes to allow individuals who might not have the ability to see to still experience this exhibit in a way.
